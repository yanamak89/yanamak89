# Hello! 👋 I'm Yana Makogon

With **9+ years in QA & Automation** and hands-on **Front-end** and **Back-end development** experience, I bring a full-stack quality mindset to every project. I build **scalable automation frameworks**, design **clean application logic**, and create **user-focused interfaces** with precision.
My work demonstrates strong engineering skills across three domains - **Automation QA**, **Front-end**, **.NET Back-end**  showing my ability to analyse systems, design solutions, and deliver maintainable, production-ready work.
