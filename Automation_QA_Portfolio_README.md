# QA Portfolio - My Testing Approach

This document demonstrates my professional approach as a QA Engineer. It
showcases how I analyse a product, design test coverage, build
automation-ready architecture, and ensure quality from both functional
and non-functional perspectives.

architecture is clean, scalable, and easy to maintain. It demonstrates
strong automation engineering practices - separation of concerns,
reusable components, and clear folder/page/test structure.
